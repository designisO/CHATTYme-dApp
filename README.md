## Description

In this project I was able to create a chat messenger app that can be used on the Ropsten Ethereum Testnet. The goal was to learn about how to implement Moralis SDK for dashboard use of chat rooms and users. I also was able to connect the metamsk wallet to the site for use. The front end was built using Bootstrap5. Chat hub names and messages of users are shown in console when viewed via devtools. Enjoy!
